**Disclaimer: This project is based on Brian Voong's Tutorial.** 

**This code may differ from his tutorial.** 
I dive deeper on some features I found interesting. For this reason, if you're following Brian's course, and you intend to use this repo expecting similar results: I would suggest you otherwise. After all, the best way to learn is to do it yourself!

Brian has plenty of great tutorials on his website https://www.letsbuildthatapp.com
