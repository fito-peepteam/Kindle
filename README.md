**Disclaimer: This project is based on Brian Voong's Tutorial - Lets Build that App (LBTA).** 
His tutorial goes over the Swift language by building a Kindle lookalike app. 

I dive deeper on some features I found interesting. So, if you're following his course and you expect similar results, do not use the code in this repo. **As it may vary from the tutorial**
